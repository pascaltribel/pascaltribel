- 👋 Hi, I’m Pascal Tribel. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Université Libre de Bruxelles.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Modelisation and Simulation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning. ;-) 
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on seismic wave simulations, using differentiable physics.
- 📫 How to reach me? Via email: pascal.tribel@ulb.be
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also a Master's student in Piano at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel.

I'm working in the Machine Learning Group (MLG: http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/) at ULB and am affiliated with TRAIL (https://trail.ac). My interests are related to spatiotemporal series analysis, especially in the context of geophysical processes such as earthquakes, volcanoes eruptions, and tsunamis. I am working on a synthetic wave propagation simulations dataset called PyAWD (https://github.com/pascaltribel/pyawd).
