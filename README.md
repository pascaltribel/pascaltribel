- 👋 Hi, I’m Pascal Tribel. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Université Libre de Bruxelles.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Modelisation and Simulation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning. ;-) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on seismic data collection.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Via email: pascal.tribel@ulb.be
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm also a Master student in Piano at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel.

I'm working in the Machine Learning Group (MLG: http://mlg.ulb.ac.be/), ULB, and I am affiliated to TRAIL (https://trail.ac). My interests are related to spatio-temporal series analysis, more specially in the context of geophysical processes, such as earthquakes, volcanoes eruptions and tsunamis. I am working on a synthetic waves propagation simulations dataset called PyAWD (https://github.com/pascaltribel/pyawd).
